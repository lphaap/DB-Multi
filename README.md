# DB-Multi
Botting software for a MMO-Game written in Java. 
Uses DreamBot-API to interact with game world and Java-Swing for a custom GUI. 
Uses swing because said API is written to support an older version of Java.

Idea of the program is handle a que of scripts that automise tasks in the game. 
These scripts are handled and executed with multithreading simultaneously with different "Anti-ban" and movement handling scripts. 
The scripts and their GUI:s can be easily programmed with templates/interfaces included in the project.

Written strictly as a personal hobby project.
